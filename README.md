## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Installation:** Clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies.


   ```
   git clone https://github.com/neokd/NeoGPT.git
   cd NeoGPT
   pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Alternatively, using conda:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/neokd/NeoGPT.git
   cd NeoGPT
   
   # Create a new Conda environment and specify the python version, for example, 'neogpt-env'
   conda create --name neogpt-env python=3.10

   # Activate the Conda environment
   conda activate neogpt-env

   # Now install the requirements using pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Building Database** Currently NeoGPT supports local files and Youtube videos. To build the database add your local files to the documents directory and URL in the `builder.url` file. Then run the builder script.
    
    ```python
        python builder.py
    ```
    This will create a database file in the `db` folder. You can also specify the database to use `--db` flag.
    Supported databases are:
    - `Chroma` (default) 
    - `FAISS` 
    - `Pinecone` (experimental)

    Currently the database is built using 2 papers: 
    - [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf)
    - [HuggingGPT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.17580.pdf)
    
    - Youtube Video from 1littlecoder: [22 AI News EXPLAINED!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPknz-hCnec)


3. **Run NeoGPT:** Run the CLI to start using NeoGPT. Requires `Python v3.10`. You can use the `--help` flag to view the available commands and options.
    ```python
        python main.py 
    ```
